Introduction
The installation of a supported Proxmox VE server should be done via Bare-metal_ISO_Installer. In some case it makes sense to install Proxmox VE on top of a running Debian Buster 64-bit, especially if you want a custom partition layout. For this HowTO the following Debian Buster ISO was used: [1].

Install a standard Debian Buster (amd64)
Install a standard Debian Buster, for details see Debian, and configure a static IP. It is recommended to only install the "standard" package selection, and nothing else, as Proxmox VE brings its own packages for qemu, lxc. A desktop environment is not necessary.

Add an /etc/hosts entry for your IP address
Please make sure that your machines hostname is resolvable via /etc/hosts, i.e. you need an entry in /etc/hosts which assigns an IPv4 address to its hostname.

Note: Make sure that no IPv6 address for your hostname is specified in /etc/hosts.

For instance, if your IP address is 192.168.15.77, and your hostname prox4m1, then your /etc/hosts file should look like:

127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain localhost
192.168.15.77   prox4m1.proxmox.com prox4m1

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
You can test if your setup is ok using the hostname command:

hostname --ip-address
192.168.15.77 # should return your IP address here
Install Proxmox VE
Adapt your sources.list
Add the Proxmox VE repository:

echo "deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve buster pve-no-subscription" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-install-repo.list
Add the Proxmox VE repository key:

wget http://download.proxmox.com/debian/proxmox-ve-release-6.x.gpg -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/proxmox-ve-release-6.x.gpg
chmod +r /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/proxmox-ve-release-6.x.gpg  # optional, if you have a non-default umask
Update your repository and system by running:

apt update && apt full-upgrade
NOTE: If you have enabled other another arch (typically, i386 to run some older software) and apt complains about not being able to find /binary-i386: "Unable to find expected entry 'pve/binary-i386/Packages'" you need to remove other arch or use instead the row:

deb [arch=amd64] http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve buster pve-no-subscription
this is because Proxmox repository does not have any other arch besides amd64; more info about multiarch on debian at: https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/HOWTO.

Install Proxmox VE packages
Install the Proxmox VE packages

apt install proxmox-ve postfix open-iscsi
Configure packages which require user input on installation according to your needs (e.g. Samba asking about WINS/DHCP support). If you have a mail server in your network, you should configure postfix as a satellite system, your existing mail server will then be the relay host which will route the emails sent by the Proxmox server to their final recipient.

If you don't know what to enter here, choose local only and leave the system name as is.

Finally, reboot your system, the new Proxmox VE kernel should be automatically selected in the GRUB menu.

Note: If you have a subscription key don't forget to switch to the enterprise repository after installation, see Package repositories.

Recommended: remove the os-prober package
The os-prober package scans all the partitions of your host, including those assigned to guests VMs, to create dual-boot GRUB entries. If you didn't install Proxmox VE as dual boot beside another Operating System, you can safely remove the os-prober package.

apt remove os-prober
Connect to the Proxmox VE web interface
Connect to the admin web interface (https://youripaddress:8006). If you have a fresh install and didn't add any users yet, you should use the root account with your linux root password, and select "PAM Authentication" to log in.

Once logged in, create a Linux Bridge called vmbr0, and add your first network interface to it.

Adapt vmbr0 settings

Troubleshooting
resolv.conf gets overwritten
The PVE GUI expects to control DNS management and will no longer take its DNS settings from /etc/network/interfaces. Any package that auto-generates (overwrites) /etc/resolv.conf will cause DNS to fail, e.g. packages 'resolvconf' for IPv4 and 'rdnssd' for IPv6.

Optional Steps
Optional: Remove the Debian kernel
apt remove linux-image-amd64 'linux-image-4.19*'
Update and check grub2 config by running:

update-grub

Finally install xShock Post Install Script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/extremeshok/xshok-proxmox/master/install-post.sh -c -O install-post.sh && bash install-post.sh && rm install-post.sh
